# Introduction
For this lab report, I would add a test both to my implementation markdown-parse, and the implementation I reviewed in week 7 for each of the three snippets provided in the instruction. I would run the tests and show the reults of running the tests on each.

# Answer to questions
1. 
> Q: Do you think there is a small (<10 lines) code change that will make your program work for snippet 1 and all related cases that use inline code with backticks? If yes, describe the code change. If not, describe why it would be a more involved change.
